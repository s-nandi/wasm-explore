# Joining Wasm Components

The wasm-components dir is a pre-requisite for this (conceptually, not with respect to code)

Inspired by the example of writing a custom library-style component and consuming it in a command-style component, in the webassembly component model introduction's section on [Running Components](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/creating-and-consuming/running.html#running-components-with-custom-exports). The [Composing Components](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/creating-and-consuming/composing.html) section of the same documentation is also helpful to see how multiple dependencies could be chained together (if you don't want to use [wasmbuilder.app](https://wasmbuilder.app/)).

## Running

cd into this directory, `cd joining-wasm-components`

Then run:
```

```
